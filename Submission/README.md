Data Bootcamp Week Nine SQL
We used SQL to create a database to answer questions.
To do this I loaded in csv's into the tables I created, and made sure it was loaded in the right order so there were no foreign key errors.
We also created a diagram for our database using quickdatabase to find correlations and which order to load in the csv's.
